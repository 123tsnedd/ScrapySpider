# ScrapySpider

For this projects I utilized the open source library Scrapy to create a spider to scrape information from Walmart, Bestbuy, and Newegg.
I had a functioning proxy attached from ScrapeOps to ensure my spider wasn't blocked.
The goal for this spider was to crawl the sites to gather information on specific computer components that I wanted to choose by having it ask for an input 
before the spider started crawling. 

I plan on continuing to update this spider to become more efficiant.
